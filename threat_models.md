# Threat Models

This document contains the detailed threat models we feel are in scope for this working group.

Attackers...
* have interest in the software being exploitable by them if users
  of the software are interesting targets.
* have interest in gaining long lasting access to the related
  infrastructure (e.g. individual developer machines, source storage,
  version control servers, CI, build servers, mirrors, etc) if that
  can be used to attack users of the software.
* can buy, steal or develop zero-day exploits if security bugs exist
  that allow this.
* can employ people to create custom engineered software or hardware
  to exploit a specific target, even if that can only be used once.
* can hire people with top qualifications or otherwise ensure someone
  becomes their agent directly or indirectly, even without their
  knowledge.
* have an interest not only in some people in an organisation that
  works on relevant software as even people without direct access can
  become a stepping stone (e.g. a people manager to influence hiring
  decisions to position their agent; someone in an adjacent office
  near more interesting people or hardware to collect information; an
  investor to buy some specific influence).
* can sustain and not use their agents to work for longer times on the
  distribution or otherwise an involved organisation until they are
  trusted enough to only then subvert it (sleeper agents).
* can influence law enforcement, courts and law makers. However this
  is somewhat, but not fully restricted by jurisdictional separation
  like nation state borders. This is not restricted to nation state
  actors due to various ways that non-state actors are afforded power
  over state institutions that may be explicitly written into law,
  implicit side effects of applied law or due to corruption.

However attackers with much fewer capabilities are commonly successful
because often even basic defenses were neglected.

List of example attacks coming soon. Currently in Google doc form: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gixyDvA0DppCDGhgzmTDxIADry7KTvldqdYO0oad2V8/edit#
